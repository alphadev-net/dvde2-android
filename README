1. This requires Android 4.1 (API level 16) or later, it was tested on a Nexus 7

2. The keyboard should show up in Android's "Language & input" settings. It should have its own section
   "PHYSICAL KEYBOARD" between "KEYBOARD & INPUT METHODS" and "SPEECH" If your keyboard isn't listed there
   then you need to solve that problem first.

3. Pick your keyboard from the settings, pick "Set up keyboard layouts" and you should see "German Dvorak Type 2"
   listed with the comment "Custom Android Keyboard".
